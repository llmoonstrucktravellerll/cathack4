How It Works
User Registration:

The user is prompted to create a username, password, and graphical password sequence.
The password is hashed using SHA-256 and stored in the in-memory database along with the graphical password and a randomly generated OTP secret.
User Login:

The user is asked to enter their username and password.
If the textual password is correct, the user is then prompted to enter their graphical password sequence.
If both are correct, an OTP is generated and displayed (in real-world applications, this would be sent via email or SMS).
The user must enter the correct OTP to complete the authentication process.
Dynamic Inputs:

The program supports dynamic user creation and login, allowing multiple users to register and authenticate.
Features
Security: Uses SHA-256 hashing for passwords and TOTP for OTP generation.
User-Friendly: Simple command-line interface with clear prompts for the user.
Self-Contained: All data is stored in memory, making it simple to run and test.
How to Run
Save the script in a .py file.
Run it using Python:

Example Flow
Register a new user:

Username: user1
Password: password123
Graphical Password: 1234
Login:

Enter the username and password.
Enter the graphical password sequence.
Enter the OTP generated by the system.
This script provides a hands-on experience with basic security concepts and is a great starting point for further enhancements, such as adding persistent storage or integrating with a real OTP delivery system.
